To change:
1) BPBR needs to match collision radius (at least for this case) Check.
2) Impulse is putting too much energy into ball			 Check (was scaling Impulse against itself)
2.A) figure out how to do this on purpose			 Selectively scale Impulse?  
2.B) fix issue							 Check
3) Movement is still working on Xform, needs to go through rigid shape completely - Better, but RigidRectangle.Move is busted
4) Selected object needs to go to mInvMass == 0.
